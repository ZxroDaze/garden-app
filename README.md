# Garden Advice Application

This is a simple command-line application that provides gardening advice based on the month. This project serves as a practical exercise, as to how one should work with Git Workflows.

## Features

-   **Monthly Advice:** Provides unique gardening tips for all 12 months of the year.
-   **Reusable Function:** The core logic is encapsulated in a well-documented `getGardeningAdvice()` function.
-   **Error Handling:** Includes a `default` case to gracefully handle invalid month inputs.
